I hold a dual PhD in Computer Science and Informatics & Automatics, specializing in Machine Learning. My research focuses on the following key areas:
</p>
 <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Generative AI</strong>: Building advanced deep learning models for generating human-like content,
      with applications in healthcare, language understanding, and time-series signal processing.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>AI Security & Privacy</strong>: Developing privacy-preserving and secure AI systems through federated learning,
      adversarial robustness, and cryptographic techniques.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Responsible AI</strong>: Promoting fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI by integrating explainability,
      bias mitigation, and ethical principles into the development process.
    </li>
  </ul>
