<p><q>A century from now, we will have departed, and unfamiliar faces will inhabit the homes we labored to construct. Our cherished belongings may be discarded, or in the possession of others. The memory of who we once were will fade for our descendants. Contemplating this inevitability, I pause and consider what I want to accomplish before it all becomes a distant past </q></p>
<ul>
<li>Travel the whole world. (on my way).</li>
<li>Solo Sky-diving. </li>
<li>Start a non-profit Organisation. (partially done).</li>
<li>Get a Doctorate (achieved).</li>
<li>Get a Private Pilot license </li>
<li> Publish my book </li>

<li>Will add more soon....</li>
</ul>
